# thebarber
I want to build a bot for my brothers barber shop. 

It has 4 key objectives:

     Allow customers to book appointments, then export that data to a calendar to be organised. 
     Inform users on the location of the barber truck today and the rest of that week
     Digitally serve up and sell products he stocks and experiences, for example a short back and sides can be paid for in advance
     Serve up barber banter and content in line with his brand and social media strategy. 
     
     
 If it is not immediatley apparent I'm a novice. I'm a designer who wants to learn how to make this.
